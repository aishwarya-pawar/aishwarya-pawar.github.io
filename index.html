My area of expertise include using machine learning algorithms to design marketing strategies; ensuring e-commerce business conversion improvement in A/B tests, and customer behavior analysis for business strategies. I was quickly promoted to become a Scrum Master of 15-member team. However, it's the excitement of digging deeper into the numbers to find a pattern, which keeps me motivated. To fuel my passion I am currently pursuing masters in Business Analytics with machine learning major at University of Texas, Austin. </p>

		<h3 class="mb-5">Corporate Projects</h2>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		  <li> <h4><b>E-Commerce site A/B Testing</b></h4> </li>
		  <p>Collaborated with 10+ e-commerce clients (fashion, automobile, pharma, home & living etc. verticals) to ensure conversion improvement in A/B tests using statistical analysis. Acquired $100k monthly recurring revenue and the framework was adopted at the enterprise level. </p>
		  
		  <li> <h4><b>Conversion Driver Analysis</b></h4> </li>
		  <p class="mb-0">Improved conversion of a market place e-commerce site by 11% using driver analysis. Also, educated the client with their analytics platform, and this helped the company build strong relationship with the client. Additionally, this analysis became a mandatory step in customer on-boarding process. </p>
		  <p>Analytics Tools: Random Forest, R, SQL (BigQuery)</p>
		  
		  <li> <h4><b>Customer acquisition analysis</b></h4> </li>
		  <p class="mb-0"> Acquired 45% of the targeted customers (in 2 weeks) by identifying potential grocery service adopters for personalized marketing campaign. </p>
		  <p>Analytics Tools: Logistic Regression, R, SQL (Hive)</p>
		  
		  <li> <h4><b>Customer Focus Group Identification, Profiling, and opportunity sizing</b></h4> </li>
		  <p> Defined a customer focus group, worth $40B, based on their time and money constraints using the data. As this was the most important customer group for the year, we built dashboards using tableau and D3 (JavaScript) to track their changing behavior. I was honoured with Star Performer Award (quarterly to top 3% achievers ) for perspicacity, and thought leadership. </p>
		  
		  <li> <h4><b>Designed an experiment to understand customer's perception of in-store music </b></h4> </li>
		  <p class="mb-0"> Working on this challenging open ended problem, I designed a fractional factorial design of experiment using transactional and demographic data of the stores. I clustered the stores to have replication and blocking of the experiment. The client highly appreciated the roadmap in the business review. </p>
		  <p>Analytics Tools: Regression driver analysis, K-mediodes clustering, fractional factorial design of experiment tool</p>
		  
		  <li> <h4><b>Holiday Server traffic forecasting</b></h4> </li>
		  <p> Forecasted server traffic for holiday to prevent downtime, which has costed $80K in the previous year. The forecast was with 4% offset from the actual traffic, which ensured 99% SLA as promised to the customers. </p>
		  
		  		  
		  <li> <h4><b>Business Review Report Automation and  executive dashboard</b></h4> </li>
		  <p class="mb-0">Automated the manual reports which took ~120 person-hours a year. Created a dashboard with real-time data. Additionally, I set up alerts for alarming peaks or drops to the engineering team to debug for any potential platform failure. Executives loved this dashboard and decided to host it on the office LCD 24x7 for a sanity check. The dashboard also became a part of sales pitch to the new customers. </p>
		  <p class="mb-5"> Analytics Tools: Google App Script, SQL(Big Query), Data Studio, Unbxd API </p>

		  <p class="mb-0">With recent the Amazon rainforest fire and Australia bushfire, there is a serious need to understand the severity of deforestation problem. In this project, I identified the reasons for  deforestation of the Amazon forest using multi-label classification image classification of it's satellite images. Additionally, I solved the problem of class-imbalance using unconventional ensemble learning to increase the recall. </p>
		  
		  <p> Analytics Tools: Convolutional Neural Networks (10-layer CNN, VGG-16, ResNet, MobileNet), XGBoost, Python, Google Cloud Platform </p>

		  <p class="mb-0"> "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don't know which half." - John Wanamaker E. Jerome. To understand which half of ad spend is working, I analyzed 4 Ps (Product, Promotion, Price, and Place) marketing mix for automobile industry. Furthermore, I used Dorfman-Steiner rule to understand if different product types have the optimal mix of price and ad spend.  </p>
		  <p> Analytics Tools: Linear Regression (OLS, Log-log), Python </p>

			  <li> <h4><b><a href="https://github.com/aishwarya-pawar/CEO-Tweets-Analysis---Natural-Language-Processing">CEO Tweets analysis</b></h4> </a> </li>
			  <p class="mb-0"> With increasing marketing strategies on social media platforms, we have witnessed how Elon Musk's tweet about Tesla going private impacted the stock market. Do the CEO tweets have influence on the stock market? Using the machine learning, I found out the answer to be 'Yes'. So, what attributes make the tweet influential? Can a CEO be more influential by including/avoiding some factors in her tweets? In this project, I found out the marketing strategies for CEOs to increase their influence on how they could attempt to influence the stock markets.  </p>
			  <p> Analytics Tools: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling (LDA), Python </p>
			  
			  
			  <li> <h4><b><a href="https://github.com/aishwarya-pawar/Instagram-Posts-Engagement-Analysis-Natural-Language-Processing">Is a picture worth thousand words on Instagram? </b></h4> </a> </li>
			  <p class="mb-0">Growing up we all remember watching the engaging National Geography programs. With growing competition, National Geography wants to understand customer preference using their posts on Instagram. In this project, I analyzed influencing posts and what are some common topics people are interested about.</p>
			  <p> Analytics Tools: Logistic Regression, Topic Modeling (LDA), Python, Google Image Extraction API </p>
			  			  
			  <li> <h4><b><a href="https://github.com/aishwarya-pawar/Automobile-Discussion-Forum-Analysis---NLP">Automobile Discussion Forum Analysis </b></h4> </a> </li>
			  <p class="mb-0">Brand perception is very important in the automobile industry. In this project, I analyzed an automobile discussion forum to understand what attributes top brands are associated with and which other brands they are compared to. Additionally, I suggested some business strategies for brand and marketing managers to improve their brand perception for their target customer groups. </p>
			  <p> Analytics Tools: Association Analysis using lifts and MDS plots, Python, Google Image Extraction API </p>
